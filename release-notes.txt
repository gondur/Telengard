=============================================
Telengard Remastered v1.1
=============================================

Bugfixes

	- Fixed bug where character sheet didn't update spell points in the inn
	- Fixed bug where walls weren't properly detected when evading a monster
	- Fixed stack overflow bug caused by too many FOR/NEXT levels due to the
	    fountain animation being left running when presented with command prompt

Modifcations

	- Modified monster progression to progressively increment minimum monster level
	    as the dungeon level increases.  Minimum monster level is half the dungeon
	    level + 1 rounded down.
	- Tweaked hobbit chance to steal to include monster level in steal chance
	- Tweaked Elven cloak to oppose 1d20+MonsterLevel instead of 1d20 and to give
	    bonuses to more powerful monster types on their checks to detect you
